What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs
What is Responsive Web Design?

Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.

Bootstrap 3 vs. Bootstrap 4
Bootstrap 4 is the newest version of Bootstrap; with new components, faster stylesheet and more responsiveness.

Bootstrap 4 supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 9 and down is not supported.

If you require IE8-9 support, use Bootstrap 3. It is the most stable version of Bootstrap, and it is still supported by the team for critical bugfixes and documentation changes. However, no new features will be added to it.

Droppped icon support: Bootstrap 4 does not support BS3 Glyphicons. Use Font-Awesome or other icon libraries instead.

Why Use Bootstrap?
Advantages of Bootstrap:

Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap
Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
Browser compatibility: Bootstrap 4 is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 10+, Safari, and Opera)
Where to Get Bootstrap 4?
There are two ways to start using Bootstrap 4 on your own web site.

You can:

Include Bootstrap 4 from a CDN
Download Bootstrap 4 from getbootstrap.com
Bootstrap 4 CDN
If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap 4 yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

MaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery:


 Latest compiled and minified CSS 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">

 jQuery library 
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

<! Popper JS 
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.0/umd/popper.min.js"></script>

<! Latest compiled JavaScript 
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
One advantage of using the Bootstrap 4 CDN:
Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 4 from MaxCDN when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.

jQuery and Popper?
Bootstrap 4 use jQuery and Popper.js for JavaScript components (like modals, tooltips, popovers etc). However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need them.

Downloading Bootstrap 4
If you want to download and host Bootstrap 4 yourself, go to https://getbootstrap.com/, and follow the instructions there.

Create First Web Page With Bootstrap 4


1. Add the HTML5 doctype

Bootstrap 4 uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the HTML5 doctype.

Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the lang attribute and the correct character set:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"> 
  </head>
</html>
2. Bootstrap 4 is mobile-first

Bootstrap 4 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.

To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag inside the <head> element:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.


3. Containers

Bootstrap 4 also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

There are two container classes to choose from:

The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport
.container
.container-fluid
