    Bootstrap 4 Grid - Large
    Large Grid Example
 	Extra small	Small	Medium	Large	Extra Large
Class prefix	.col-	.col-sm-	.col-md-	.col-lg-	.col-xl-
Screen width	<576px	>=576px	>=768px	>=992px	>=1200px
In the previous chapter, we presented a grid example with classes for small and medium devices. We used two divs (columns) and we gave them a 25%/75% split on small devices, and a 50%/50% split on medium devices:

<div class="col-sm-3 col-md-6">....</div>
<div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6">....</div>
But on large devices the design may be better as a 33%/66% split.

Large devices are defined as having a screen width from 992 pixels to 1199 pixels.

For large devices we will use the .col-lg-* classes:

<div class="col-sm-3 col-md-6 col-lg-4">....</div>
<div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6 col-lg-8">....</div>
Now Bootstrap is going to say "at the small size, look at classes with -sm- in them and use those. At the medium size, look at classes with -md- in them and use those. At the large size, look at classes with the word -lg- in them and use those".

The following example will result in a 25%/75% split on small devices, a 50%/50% split on medium devices, and a 33%/66% split on large and xlarge devices. On extra small devices, it will automatically stack (100%):

.col-sm-3 .col-md-6 .col-lg-4
.col-sm-9 .col-md-6 .col-lg-8
