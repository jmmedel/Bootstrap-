The new generation of project management tools is here and it’s visual.

Examples
Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button. For proper styling, use one of the eight required contextual classes (e.g., .alert-success). For inline dismissal, use the alerts jQuery plugin.

This is a primary alert—check it out!
This is a secondary alert—check it out!
This is a success alert—check it out!
This is a danger alert—check it out!
This is a warning alert—check it out!
This is a info alert—check it out!
This is a light alert—check it out!
This is a dark alert—check it out!

Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the .sr-only class.

Link color
Use the .alert-link utility class to quickly provide matching colored links within any alert.

This is a primary alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
This is a secondary alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
This is a success alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
This is a danger alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
This is a warning alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
This is a info alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
This is a light alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.
This is a dark alert with an example link. Give it a click if you like.

Additional content
Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs and dividers.

Well done!
Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.

Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.

Copy
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Well done!</h4>
  <p>Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.</p>
  <hr>
  <p class="mb-0">Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.</p>
</div>
Dismissing
Using the alert JavaScript plugin, it’s possible to dismiss any alert inline. Here’s how:

Be sure you’ve loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript.
If you’re building our JavaScript from source, it requires util.js. The compiled version includes this.
Add a dismiss button and the .alert-dismissible class, which adds extra padding to the right of the alert and positions the .close button.
On the dismiss button, add the data-dismiss="alert" attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be sure to use the <button> element with it for proper behavior across all devices.
To animate alerts when dismissing them, be sure to add the .fade and .show classes.
You can see this in action with a live demo:

Holy guacamole! You should check in on some of those fields below. × Copy
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
  <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of those fields below.
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
    <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
  </button>
</div>
JavaScript behavior
Triggers
Enable dismissal of an alert via JavaScript:

Copy
$('.alert').alert()
Or with data attributes on a button within the alert, as demonstrated above:

Copy
<button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
  <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
</button>
Note that closing an alert will remove it from the DOM.

Methods
Method	Description
$().alert()	Makes an alert listen for click events on descendant elements which have the data-dismiss="alert" attribute. (Not necessary when using the data-api’s auto-initialization.)
$().alert('close')	Closes an alert by removing it from the DOM. If the .fade and .show classes are present on the element, the alert will fade out before it is removed.
$().alert('dispose')	Destroys an element’s alert.Copy
$(".alert").alert('close')
Events
Bootstrap’s alert plugin exposes a few events for hooking into alert functionality.

Event	Description
close.bs.alert	This event fires immediately when the close instance method is called.
closed.bs.alert	This event is fired when the alert has been closed (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).Copy
$('#myAlert').on('closed.bs.alert', function () {
  // do something…
})
